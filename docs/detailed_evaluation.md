## Model-Specific Evaluation Results

### CodeLlama-13B-Instruct

#### Strengths Demonstrated
1. **Superior Code Comprehension**
   - Correctly identifies complex algorithmic patterns
   - Understands context and intent beyond surface syntax
   - Recognizes idiomatic vs. non-idiomatic Python code

2. **Educational Prompt Excellence**
   - Generates Socratic questions that guide discovery
   - Maintains appropriate difficulty progression
   - Avoids revealing solutions while providing guidance

3. **Misconception Detection**
   - Identifies 18/20 common beginner misconceptions in benchmark tests
   - Provides educational context for why misconceptions occur
   - Suggests pedagogically sound correction strategies

#### Quantitative Results
```
Code Understanding Score: 8.7/10
Educational Alignment Score: 9.2/10
Prompt Quality Score: 8.9/10
Resource Efficiency Score: 7.8/10
Overall Benchmark Performance: 87.3%
```

#### Sample Output Analysis
**Student Code:**
```python
def find_max(numbers):
    max_num = numbers[0]
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        if numbers[i] > max_num:
            max_num = numbers[i]
    return max_num
```

**CodeLlama-13B Analysis:**
> "I notice you're using `range(len(numbers))` to iterate through the list. This approach works, but Python offers more elegant ways to handle this. Can you think of how you might iterate directly over the list elements? Also, consider what would happen if someone passes an empty list to your function - how might you handle that edge case?"

**Educational Quality Assessment:**
- Identifies misconception without direct correction
- Poses guiding questions for discovery
- Introduces edge case thinking
- Maintains encouraging tone
- Appropriate complexity for skill level

### Detailed Model Comparison Results with Examples

#### Comparative Analysis: Loop Optimization Misconception

**Test Code:**
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for i in range(len(numbers)):
    print(numbers[i])
```

**Model Response Analysis:**

**CodeLlama-13B-Instruct (Educational Score: 9/10):**
> "I notice you're using `range(len(numbers))` to iterate through your list. This works, but Python has more elegant approaches. Can you think of a way to iterate directly over the list elements? What might be the advantages of different iteration approaches?"

**StarCoder2-15B (Educational Score: 7/10):**
> "This code works but isn't Pythonic. You should use `for number in numbers:` instead. This is more readable and efficient."

**Key Difference:** CodeLlama provides guided questioning that encourages discovery, while StarCoder directly provides solutions without building understanding.

#### Exception Handling Conceptual Understanding Test

**Test Code:**
```python
def divide_numbers(a, b):
    return a / b

result = divide_numbers(10, 0)
```

**Comparative Educational Responses:**

**CodeLlama-13B-Instruct:**
> "Your function works for most cases, but what happens when b is zero? How might you handle this situation gracefully? Think about what you'd want to communicate to someone using your function."

**Codestral-22B:**
> "This function will raise a ZeroDivisionError when b=0. You should add exception handling using try-except blocks or input validation."

**Educational Analysis:** CodeLlama's response encourages critical thinking about edge cases and user experience, while Codestral focuses on technical implementation details.
